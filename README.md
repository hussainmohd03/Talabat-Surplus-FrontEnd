## Date: 14/08/2025

### [TALABAT PLUS BACKEND REPO](https://github.com/hussainmohd03/Food-Waste-BackEnd) | [DEPLOYED VERSION]()

### By: [Hussain Ahmed](https://github.com/hussainmohd03) | [Malak Jasim](https://github.com/Malak1805) | [Maryam Ali Redha](https://github.com/maryamalihasanebrahim)

## **Description**

TALABAT PLUS is a MERN stack web application inspired by the popular TALABAT food delivery platform. Instead of browsing only active restaurant menus, users use the application for surplus meals that become available when bulk orders go unclaimed.

When a restaurant or vendor prepares extra portions—whether from large group orders, catering events, or over-prepped menu items—TALABAT PLUS allows them to list their surplus deals. Users who are on the app can view listings certain food types, allowing them to claim these items at a discounted price before they’re gone.

## **Planning & Inspiration**

The color palette, logo, and overall styling of the application was heavily inspired by TALABAT’s latest app version.

The original scope of the project encompassed five entities in total. Order, customer, restaurant, food, and review. The current scope only covers four of the original five.
